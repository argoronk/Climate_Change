# G4 Climate_Change
Argo Ronk

Motivation: To understand how endangered species can cope with the ongoing climate change in the future.<br />

GOAL: Determine the current distribution of globally endangered species in Europe and using bioclimatic variables (future projections) to determine how and if the distribution of globally endangered species in Europe could change.<br />

Repository has python code (jupyter notebook named "G4_Climate_Change_code") in order to replicate the same analysis. All the preprocessed (using ArcGIS) species occurrenceâ€™s data (individual csv files for every species) with current (data within individual csv files for every species) and future bioclimatic variables (file named "Future_Condition.csv") needed to successfully run the code has been added to repository.For descriptive statistics file "Bioclim_variables_final.csv" is also added.<br />
